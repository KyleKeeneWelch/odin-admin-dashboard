This project is a project undertaken as part of `The Odin Project` learning web course teaching `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` skills. It involved putting into practice the teachings of `CSS Grid` taught in the previous lessons to put together an effective grid structure in the webpage and to place page elements to suit a design.

The project hands a webpage mockup of which is the aim outcome structure and appeal. It is up to the developer to use the taught skills of `flexbox`, `grid` and `relative units` to appropriately structure and place elements much like the design. Grid is a powerful tool that enables developers to incorporate complex structures that would either be difficult or impossible to replicate in flexbox. The practice of this tool is a great way to introduce it into future projects where the benefits of using grid will heighten the development process and produce effective webpages.

Also included is the use of media queries to alter page structure and elements so that they reflect upon the device viewing the page. Devices with bigger and smaller viewports are accomodated through the alteration of the sidebar and page content so borders of content do not overflow the edges of the device and content can be read and understood clearly.

## Features

- **Flexbox and Grid** - Uses flexbox and grid tools to position and structure page elements according to the design.

- **SVG Icons** - Uses SVG graphics to represent icons within buttons on the page. These use mathematical values to recreate shapes and structure to represent known icons with meaning.

- **Media Queries and Responsiveness** - Uses media queries to assess the current size of the viewport and applies styles when certain breakpoints are met. Breakpoints include a medium iPad-like size and a small mobile-like size. Styles change elements to fit the device.
